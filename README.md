### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nathan Gallo and I'm an Emerging Technologies Engineer. 

I have a Bachelors degree in Accounting and worked as an investment accountant for one year. I then got a job in the same company as an investment analyst. My company offered a coding bootcamp to train employees and place them in developer roles, I was intrigued by this and took part. I loved coding and I'm now excited to grow my skills and continue down the architect career path.
